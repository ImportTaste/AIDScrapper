Usage: python manage.py [publish/stories/scenarios/makenai/fenix] [title] [min_number_of_actions]

-------------------

Ex: python manage.py stories "My Story" 1000

Downloads any story from your account named "My Story",
then proceeds to dump it to the stories.json. mystuff_json_to_html.py is called
then to convert the file to html, so be sure you named it that way. Also you need style.css to be
in the folder too (is not important, so you can just make a blank file with that name).

It will not download any story with less than 1000 actions in this case, if you want to download 
any story with more than 1000 actions use:

python manage.py stories \"\" 1000

Note the \"\" and note that if you put python manage.py stories 1000 it will download any story 
named \"1000\".

---------------------

Ex: python manage.py scenarios "My Scenario"

Same as before.

--------------------

Ex: publish "My Scenario"

You can publish it afterwards.

Ex: fenix

Posts all your stuff (stored in the .json) on your account.

--------------------

less than 10 actions are ignored) and makes the html
