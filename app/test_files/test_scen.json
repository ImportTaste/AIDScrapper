Kate had just gotten back from the University a few minutes ago, and she is in her room unpacking and changing into her home clothes. Meanwhile, you are in the living room, lazing on the couch and watching sitcoms on TV. In the middle of a particularly sappy romance scene, you glance out the window and see that the snowfall has picked up considerably, with dense curtains of snow blocking out the streetlights of your neighborhood. Curious, you switch over to the weather channel to check on the latest forecast. You see a weatherman standing in front of a weather radar map of your area, which is covered in red, purple, and white splotches.\n\n\"Hey Kate!\" You call out to your sister.\n\"Yeah?\" She calls back.\n\"Come here! You have to see this!\" You say to her.\n\nThe bedroom door opens and Kate steps out into the hallway, quickly fixing her clothes as she makes her way over to the living room with a curious look on her face. You gesture for Kate to look at the TV, and she immediately freezes in place as soon as she sees the weather map on the screen.\n\n\"Holy shit.\" She says in surprise as she sits down beside you on the couch. You both listen intently as the weatherman explains the forecast - a severe winter storm warning from tonight over the next few days.\n\n\"Well... looks like we aren't going anywhere for a while.\" You say to Kate with a bemused chuckle.\n\"Pffh, as if I was ever planning on leaving the house anyways. It's winter break for Chrissakes!\" She scoffs. \"But hey, at least now I'll have another excuse to hang out with you, eh?
